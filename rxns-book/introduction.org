#+STARTUP: showall

* Course software setup

- Your laptops have already been setup with the software you need for this course
  + Emacs + jmax
  + Python
  + git 
  + ssh

** Course setup

This course is run by Techela (Technology Enhanced Learning and Assessment), developed by Prof. Kitchin. This software uses Emacs as a content generation and delivery system, with git, a distributed version control software, to securely share files between instructors and students.

You will install the course like this:

- Open Emacs
- Type Alt-x techela
- You will be prompted for a course name. Type f14-06625 and press enter.
- You will be prompted for a userid. Enter your andrewid and press enter.
- You will be prompted for your full name. Type that in, and press enter.
- Emacs will then download the course for you, and send me your public ssh key so you can access the assignments. After I register your ssh key, you will have access to assignments.
- Emacs will keep the course notes up to date, and tell you when assignments are due, etc...


- Lecture notes are written in a format known as org-mode, which is a lightweight, text-based markup language
- The notes are best viewed in Emacs, which knows how to render equations and figures, and allows you to run the code and capture the results.

** Python setup

- Enthought Canopy is already installed  
   - It has most of what we will need this semester
- You should request an academic license at https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/ as it will give you access to a lot of additional packages you may find helpful.

- We will install new packages as needed

*** Additional python packages to install

Put your cursor in this code block and run it (C-c C-c). This will install some additional packages we will use in the course.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from setuptools.command import easy_install

for pkg in ['pycse', 'quantities', 'pint',
            'uncertainties', 'jedi', 'rope']:
    easy_install.main(['-U', pkg])
#+END_SRC

After you install those, this code block will tell you about the installed versions of the most important libraries we will use in Python.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy
print('numpy version {}'.format(numpy.__version__))

import scipy
print('scipy version {}'.format(scipy.__version__))

import matplotlib
print('matplotlib version {}'.format(matplotlib.__version__))

import quantities
print('quantities version {}'.format(quantities.__version__))

import uncertainties 
print('uncertainties version {}'.format(uncertainties.__version__))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: numpy version 1.8.0
: scipy version 0.14.0
: matplotlib version 1.3.1
: quantities version 0.10.1
: uncertainties version 2.4.6

- Your ssh public key must be registered for you to participate in the course.
  - This should be automatically sent to me when you open the course
  - I will send a confirmation email when I get it and it is registered.

- Most assignments will be listed as links in the syllabus
  + When you click on the link, Emacs will download a copy of the assignment to your computer and open it

  + You will complete the assignment in Emacs. This will typically mean typing in narrative text to describe what you are doing, the code that solves your problem, running the code to get the output, and discussing the results.

  + You will complete your assignments using the same tool we use in class, Emacs + org-mode + Python.

  + You will complete the assignment, and "turn it in" by selecting "Turn assignment in" from the techela menu, after you have completed the assignment.

  + Turning an assignment in requires you to be connected to the internet

  + Some information about your computer will be collected and turned in with your work.

- Sometimes there will be "Exercises" that we do in class. These will not always be graded, but they will be used as part of a participation grade. Make sure you bring your computer to class.

* Introduction to the course

** What is Chemical Reaction Engineering?

- The design of processes that transform lower value feedstocks to higher value products through chemical reactions.

We answer questions such as:
1) Can we make a product at an economical rate?
2) How big should a reactor be to make a product at some rate?
3) How much heat should I remove from a reactor to maintain a safe temperature?
4) What kind of reactor gives the highest yield?
5) etc...

** We are engineers

We get paid to answer those questions 
- /quantitatively/
  - It will rarely be sufficient to qualitatively answer questions 
- with uncertainty and risk analysis
- even when the problems are very hard

** Role of computational tools

- Many problems are too hard to solve by hand and must be solved numerically. 
  - For these we use computational methods

- We will extensively use Emacs in this class
 + to read course notes
 + to solve computational problems
 + to document our work, analysis, and discussion
 + to turn in our work

- We will extensively use Python to numerically solve problems in this course.

- Why?
  + Python is /free/
  + You can use this anywhere you go
  + Python does everything we need and much more
  + Python integrates into org-mode very well, enabling these notes to exist.

- Almost every class will use and show examples of python
- These notes will be available to you through the syllabus
- You should make sure you can run the examples, /and that you get the same results/
- *Ask questions when you do not understand*

** Python examples

*** A simple plot

Here we import functionality from python modules to get array math functions and to make a plot. 
Put your cursor in this code block and press C-c C-c to run the block.

Let us review some python documentation. Click on these links to learn more about these functions:
pydoc:numpy.linspace
pydoc:numpy.exp

pydoc:matplotlib.pyplot.plot
pydoc:matplotlib.pyplot.xlabel
pydoc:matplotlib.pyplot.ylabel
pydoc:matplotlib.pyplot.savefig

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np               # standard import for array functions
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # standard import for plotting

# Define some constants
R = 8.314   # A float
T = 300     # an integer

# an array of values linearly spaced
deltaG = np.linspace(-8000, -12000)

# plotting commands
plt.plot(deltaG, np.exp(-deltaG / R / T))
plt.xlabel('$\Delta G$')
plt.ylabel('K')
plt.savefig('images/K.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/K.png]]

Note: to get the image to show inline, you must manually put a figure link in the place you want it, and then run the code block.
 
*** Solve nonlinear equations
elisp:org-toggle-latex-overlays 

Suppose we know K at some temperature, and we want to compute the corresponding $\Delta G$? Say we know K = 100 at 300K.  We need to solve $100 = e^{-\Delta G/RT}$ for $\Delta G$ at T = 300 K. Numerically,  we need to find the value of $\Delta G$ that solves this equivalent equation:

\[0 = 100 - e^{-\Delta G/RT}\]

We have to provide a guess for the solution because this is a nonlinear function we are solving. We could solve this problem analytically, but we are not going to. Instead, we will use the analytical solution to show our numerical solution is correct.

pydoc:scipy.optimize.fsolve

Put your cursor in this code block and press Ctrl-c Ctrl-c (C-c C-c) to run the block.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np                  # array based math functions
from scipy.optimize import fsolve   # nonlinear algebra solver

R = 8.314  # J/mol/K
T = 300    # K

# define a function that equals zero at the solution
def objective(deltaG):
    return 100 - np.exp(-deltaG / R / T)

guess = -11000   # guess based on the graph we saw before
ans, = fsolve(objective, guess)

print(ans)
print(-np.log(100) * R * T)  # analytical solution
#+END_SRC



You can see the two solutions are equivalent. Checkout pydoc:numpy.log


*** Solving another nonlinear algebra problem
elisp:org-toggle-latex-overlays  

Given \(C_A = C_{A0} e^{-k t}\) with $C_{A0} =1$ mol/L, and $k=0.23$ 1/s, how long will it take before $C_A$ = 0.2 M? We want to know at what time is this equation true: \(0.2 - C_{A0} e^{-k t} = 0\). We define two functions here, one for $C_A$, and one for the objective function ($f(x)=0$). That is so we can evaluate $C_A(t_{soln})$ conveniently later.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

CA0 = 1.0 # mol / l
k = 0.23  # 1/s

def Ca(t):
    return CA0 * np.exp(-k * t)

def f(t):
    z = 0.2 - Ca(t)
    return z

ans, = fsolve(f, 2.0)
print('Ca = {0} at t = {1} s'.format(Ca(ans), ans))
#+END_SRC
