* Some advanced topics in units

** Using units with fsolve, odeint, other functions

- Using units outside of =quantities=, e.g. with fsolve, or odeint will often not work without some extra effort
  - The best case scenario is you get an error
  - More often, units will simply be lost or dropped

- This is a general problem
  - 3^{rd} party packages were not designed with =quantities= in mind, and =quantities= cannot know of every 3^{rd} party package
  - This is an issue with /every/ units package around
  - some software packages may be more integrated than others, e.g. Mathematica, or Maple (these are standalone packages)
  - Other packages, e.g. Matlab, python, or C or Fortran need to be considered carefully

- It is /however/ possible to write "wrapper" functions for using =quantities= with 3^{rd} party packages

- Typically, you store the units going into the problem, if necessary compute the units on the output, and put them back onto the answer.

- Let us consider some typical problems.

** quantities in fsolve

- Consider a CSTR with inlet molar flow of 3 mol/min of A at 1 L/min, a rate law of $-r_A = k C_A$, with $k=0.34$ 1/hr. Determine the volume required for 80% conversion of A.

- We need to solve $0 = F_{A0} - F_A + r_A V$ for $V$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import quantities as u
from scipy.optimize import fsolve as _fsolve # give fsolve a new name

Fa0 = 3 * u.mol / u.min
Fa = Fa0*(1 - 0.8)
nu = 1*u.L/u.min
k = 0.34 * 1 / u.hr

def objective(V):
    Ca = Fa / nu
    rA = -k * Ca
    return Fa0 - Fa + rA * V

def fsolve(func, t0):
    'wrapped fsolve command to work with quantities'
    # store the units on the initial guess
    tU = 1 * t0.units  # units on initial guess, normalized

    # wrap the function so it returns a regular number
    def wrapped_func(t):
        't will be unitless, so we add unit to it. t * tU has units.'
        return float(func(t * tU))

    # use the original fsolve with the wrapped function
    sol, = _fsolve(wrapped_func, t0)

    # put the original units back on the solution
    return sol * tU

print(fsolve(objective, 10*u.L))

# Confirm the answer is correct with no units
def objective_nounits(V):
    k = 0.34 / 60.0 # 1/min    A unit conversion by hand
    Fa0 = 3.0       # mol/min
    Fa = Fa0 * (1 - 0.8)
    nu = 1.0
    Ca = Fa / nu
    rA = -k * Ca
    return Fa0 - Fa + rA * V

print(_fsolve(objective_nounits, 10))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 705.882352941 L
: [ 705.88235294]

- This was an /easy/ example because the units on the output of fsolve are the same as the units of the initial guess

- The fsolve function we wrote does not have all the features of scipy.optimize.fsolve.
  - You can add those, but it is much more complicated
  - see http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2013/03/22/Handling-units-with-the-quantities-module/ for a more comprehensive example

- Consider the tradeoffs in this approach
 - On one hand, we had to wrap a function in a non-intuitive way
 - We got the units on the answer "for free" after all that work
 - On the other hand, we did not do /any/ unit-conversions by hand
 - We also did not have to modify our equations

- PYCSE provides some of this functionality
- You need the latest version of pycse for this functionality
- Run this block to make sure you have the most recent version

PYCSE (v1.47+) provides this wrapped function pydoc:pycse.qmath.fsolve.

- You should use this with skepticism and engineering judgment
  1. It has not been used a lot
  2. Code with units is fragile, and it is possible you will find a way to break it

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from pycse import fsolve
import quantities as u

Fa0 = 3 * u.mol / u.min
Fa = Fa0*(1 - 0.8)
nu = 1*u.L/u.min
k = 0.34 * 1 / u.hr

def objective(V):
    Ca = Fa / nu
    rA = -k * Ca
    return Fa0 - Fa + rA * V

print(fsolve(objective, 10*u.L))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [ 705.88235294] L

- Let us consider another approach: dimensionless equations.
- We needed to solve \(0 = F_{A0} - F_A - k F_A / \nu V \)
- Let us define a new variable: $G = F_A / F_{A0}$ or $F_A = G F_{A0}$
- Let us define $\tau = V / \nu$, which is a residence time
- Finally, note that $k \tau$ is a dimensionless quantity.
  - Let us call it $D$
- The equation becomes
\(0 = 1 - G - D G \)
  - This equation should have only dimensionless quantities.
  - We need to find the value of D that solves it.
  - Then we can compute $V$ with units, as $V = \frac{D \nu}{k}$

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
Fa0 = 3.0                 # mol/min
Fa = Fa0 * (1.0 - 0.8)    # mol/min
G = Fa / Fa0

def objective(D):
    return 1 - G - D * G

Dsol, = fsolve(objective, 1.0)

import quantities as u
nu = 1 * u.L / u.min
k = 0.34 * 1 / u.hr

# V = D * nu / k
print('Volume = {}'.format(Dsol * nu / k))   # this prints oddly
                                             # (time/time) because the
                                             # units are not simplified
print((Dsol * nu / k).simplified)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Volume = 11.7647058824 h*L/min
: 0.705882352941 m**3

- This method has a different set of tradeoffs
  - We had to derive dimensionless equations
    - And the result looks trivial to solve in this case
  - Our dimensionless quantities were easy to check in this case
  - On the other hand, we did not do any unit conversions at the end
  - We used the standard fsolve function
  - We avoided wrapping the function

** quantities in odeint

- The units on the output of odeint are the units of the initial condition
- Let us examine a constant volume batch reactor with $-r_A = k C_A$, and $k = 0.0006$ L/mol/s, and ask what is the concentration of $A$ after 10 minutes if the initial concentration is $C_A(t=0) = 1$ mol / L.

\( \frac{dC_A}{dt} = r_A \)

*** Analytical solution with no units
- Here we know the solution $C_A = C_{A0} \exp(-k t)$. We evaluate it for future reference.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
Ca0 = 1
k = 0.0006 * 60     # L / mol / min
t = 10              # min
print(Ca0 * np.exp(-k * t))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.697676326071

*** Numerical solution with no units

- Now we re-solve the problem, using odeint with no units.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint
Ca0 = 1.0
k = 0.0006 * 60  # unit conversion by hand to L / mol / min

def dCadt(Ca, t):
    ra = -k * Ca
    return ra

tspan = np.linspace(0, 10) # this is in minutes

sol = odeint(dCadt, Ca0, tspan)
print(sol[-1, 0])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.697676302326

Same answer. Still no units.

*** Using quantities with a wrapped odeint function		     :gotcha:

- Let us consider wrapping the odeint function

- This is subtle. We have make sure the derivative value is scaled to the correct units.
  - Otherwise the derivative will not be in consistent units, in this case it would be mol / L / s, while the time step would be in minutes
  - This is not obvious that should have to do that!
  - That is one very big downside to this approach
  - And it underscores the need to test new approaches

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import quantities as u
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint as _odeint

Ca0 = 1.0 * u.mol / u.L
k = 0.0006 * 1 / u.s

def dCadt(Ca, t):
    ra  = -k * Ca
    return ra

def odeint(dydx, y0, xspan):
    # get x units
    xU = 1.0 * xspan[0].units
    yU = 1.0 * y0.units

    def wrapped_dydx(y, x):
        v = dydx(y * yU, x * xU).rescale(yU / xU)
        return float(v)

    sol = _odeint(wrapped_dydx, float(y0), [float(x) for x in xspan])
    return sol * yU

tspan = np.linspace(0.0, 10.0)*u.min

sol = odeint(dCadt, Ca0, tspan)
print('The answer is {}'.format(sol[-1, 0]))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The answer is 0.697676302326 mol/L

- We finally get the right answer, with the correct units

- PYCSE offers a limited support for this.
- This is a fragile approach, but one that you can check pretty easily.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import quantities as u
import numpy as np
from pycse import odeint

Ca0 = 1.0 * u.mol / u.L
k = 0.0006 * 1 / u.s

def dCadt(Ca, t):
    ra  = -k * Ca
    return ra

# This does not work! The units are not scaled properly
#tspan = np.linspace(0.0, 10.0)*u.min
tspan = np.linspace(0.0, 600.0)*u.sec

sol = odeint(dCadt, Ca0, tspan)
print(sol[-1, 0])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.697676302326 mol/L

- This last example underscores again the need to be careful when working with units.


* Advanced usage of fsolve

- We have thus far used fsolve in the simplest way possible.
- We have used the output of the function, or the success of the function as an indication that it worked
  - We may also have used the answer in our objective function to confirm we got an answer near zero.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def objective(x):
    return np.exp(x) - 2.0

sol, info, ier, message = fsolve(objective, 0.5, full_output=True)
if ier == 1:
    print(message)
else:
    print('fsolve did not finish correctly. Check your work')

print('''
Nsteps taken = {info[nfev]}
objective(sol) = {info[fvec]}'''.format(info=info))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The solution converged.
:
: Nsteps taken = 8
: objective(sol) = [ 0.]

- This kind of information is especially helpful in longer programs, or when you embed fsolve in a loop
- You can use programming to catch errors and handle them gracefully
  - This is outside the scope of this course

- There are many more options to consider with fsolve that control a variety of properties.

       xtol=1.49012e-08, maxfev=0, band=None, epsfcn=None, factor=100,
       diag=None)
    Find the roots of a function.

    Return the roots of the (non-linear) equations defined by
    ``func(x) = 0`` given a starting estimate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable ``f(x, *args)``
        A function that takes at least one (possibly vector) argument.
    x0 : ndarray
        The starting estimate for the roots of ``func(x) = 0``.
    args : tuple, optional
        Any extra arguments to `func`.
    fprime : callable(x), optional
        A function to compute the Jacobian of `func` with derivatives
        across the rows. By default, the Jacobian will be estimated.
    full_output : bool, optional
        If True, return optional outputs.
    col_deriv : bool, optional
        Specify whether the Jacobian function computes derivatives down
        the columns (faster, because there is no transpose operation).
    xtol : float
        The calculation will terminate if the relative error between two
        consecutive iterates is at most `xtol`.
    maxfev : int, optional
        The maximum number of calls to the function. If zero, then
        ``100*(N+1)`` is the maximum where N is the number of elements
        in `x0`.
    band : tuple, optional
        If set to a two-sequence containing the number of sub- and
        super-diagonals within the band of the Jacobi matrix, the
        Jacobi matrix is considered banded (only for ``fprime=None``).
    epsfcn : float, optional
        A suitable step length for the forward-difference
        approximation of the Jacobian (for ``fprime=None``). If
        `epsfcn` is less than the machine precision, it is assumed
        that the relative errors in the functions are of the order of
        the machine precision.
    factor : float, optional
        A parameter determining the initial step bound
        (``factor * || diag * x||``).  Should be in the interval
        ``(0.1, 100)``.
    diag : sequence, optional
        N positive entries that serve as a scale factors for the
        variables.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        The solution (or the result of the last iteration for
        an unsuccessful call).
    infodict : dict
        A dictionary of optional outputs with the keys:

          * 'nfev' : number of function calls
          * 'njev' : number of Jacobian calls
          * 'fvec' : function evaluated at the output
          * 'fjac' : the orthogonal matrix, q, produced by the QR
                    factorization of the final approximate Jacobian
                    matrix, stored column wise
          * 'r' : upper triangular matrix produced by QR factorization
                  of the same matrix
          * 'qtf': the vector ``(transpose(q) * fvec)``

    ier : int
        An integer flag.  Set to 1 if a solution was found, otherwise refer
        to `mesg` for more information.
    mesg : str
        If no solution is found, `mesg` details the cause of failure.

    .. versionadded:: 0.11.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        A vector function to find a root of.
    x0 : ndarray
        Initial guess.
    args : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments passed to the objective function and its Jacobian.
    method : str, optional
        Type of solver.  Should be one of

            - 'hybr'
            - 'lm'
            - 'broyden1'

    jac : bool or callable, optional
        If `jac` is a Boolean and is True, `fun` is assumed to return the
        value of Jacobian along with the objective function. If False, the
        Jacobian will be estimated numerically.
        `jac` can also be a callable returning the Jacobian of `fun`. In
        this case, it must accept the same arguments as `fun`.
    tol : float, optional
        Tolerance for termination. For detailed control, use solver-specific
        options.
    callback : function, optional
        Optional callback function. It is called on every iteration as
        ``callback(x, f)`` where `x` is the current solution and `f`
        the corresponding residual. For all methods but 'hybr' and 'lm'.
    options : dict, optional
        A dictionary of solver options. E.g. `xtol` or `maxiter`, see
        ``show_options('root', method)`` for details.

    Returns
    -------
    sol : Result
        The solution represented as a ``Result`` object.
        Important attributes are: ``x`` the solution array, ``success`` a
        Boolean flag indicating if the algorithm exited successfully and
        ``message`` which describes the cause of the termination. See
        `Result` for a description of other attributes.

    Notes
    -----
    This section describes the available solvers that can be selected by the
    'method' parameter. The default method is *hybr*.

    Method *hybr* uses a modification of the Powell hybrid method as
    implemented in MINPACK [1]_.

    Method *lm* solves the system of nonlinear equations in a least squares
    sense using a modification of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as
    implemented in MINPACK [1]_.

    Methods *broyden1*, *broyden2*, *anderson*, *linearmixing*,
    *diagbroyden*, *excitingmixing*, *krylov* are inexact Newton methods,
    with backtracking or full line searches [2]_. Each method corresponds
    to a particular Jacobian approximations. See `nonlin` for details.

    - Method *broyden1* uses Broyden's first Jacobian approximation, it is
      known as Broyden's good method.
    - Method *broyden2* uses Broyden's second Jacobian approximation, it
      is known as Broyden's bad method.
    - Method *anderson* uses (extended) Anderson mixing.
    - Method *Krylov* uses Krylov approximation for inverse Jacobian. It
      is suitable for large-scale problem.
    - Method *diagbroyden* uses diagonal Broyden Jacobian approximation.
    - Method *linearmixing* uses a scalar Jacobian approximation.
    - Method *excitingmixing* uses a tuned diagonal Jacobian
      approximation.

    .. warning::

        The algorithms implemented for methods *diagbroyden*,
        *linearmixing* and *excitingmixing* may be useful for specific
        problems, but whether they will work may depend strongly on the
        problem.

** Parameterized fsolve
Suppose we want to solve a nonlinear algebra problem for many values of a parameter.

Let the reaction $\ce{A -> B}$ take place in a CSTR with a volume of 10 L, and $r = 2.3 C_A$.

The inlet concentration is 1.5 mol / L of A.

You need to compute the exit conversion for a range of volumetric flows.

We know that we are solving:
\(0 = Fa0 - Fa + r_A V\)

We have to resolve this problem /many/ times for different values of v0.

Rather than redefine the equation over and over, we parameterize the objective function with an additional argument.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

V = 10.0
Ca0 = 1.5

# v0 is a /parameter/
def objective(Ca, v0):
    ra = -2.3 * Ca
    return Ca0 * v0 - Ca * v0 + ra * V

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    ml, mu : int, optional
        If either of these are not None or non-negative, then the
        Jacobian is assumed to be banded.  These give the number of
        lower and upper non-zero diagonals in this banded matrix.
        For the banded case, `Dfun` should return a matrix whose
        columns contain the non-zero bands (starting with the
        lowest diagonal).  Thus, the return matrix from `Dfun` should
        have shape ``len(y0) * (ml + mu + 1)`` when ``ml >=0`` or ``mu >=0``.
    rtol, atol : float, optional
        The input parameters `rtol` and `atol` determine the error
        control performed by the solver.  The solver will control the
        vector, e, of estimated local errors in y, according to an
        inequality of the form ``max-norm of (e / ewt) <= 1``,
        where ewt is a vector of positive error weights computed as
        ``ewt = rtol * abs(y) + atol``.
        rtol and atol can be either vectors the same length as y or scalars.
        Defaults to 1.49012e-8.
    tcrit : ndarray, optional
        Vector of critical points (e.g. singularities) where integration
        care should be taken.
    h0 : float, (0: solver-determined), optional
        The step size to be attempted on the first step.
    hmax : float, (0: solver-determined), optional
        The maximum absolute step size allowed.
    hmin : float, (0: solver-determined), optional
        The minimum absolute step size allowed.
    ixpr : bool, optional
        Whether to generate extra printing at method switches.
    mxstep : int, (0: solver-determined), optional
        Maximum number of (internally defined) steps allowed for each
        integration point in t.
    mxhnil : int, (0: solver-determined), optional
        Maximum number of messages printed.
    mxordn : int, (0: solver-determined), optional
        Maximum order to be allowed for the non-stiff (Adams) method.
    mxords : int, (0: solver-determined), optional
        Maximum order to be allowed for the stiff (BDF) method.
