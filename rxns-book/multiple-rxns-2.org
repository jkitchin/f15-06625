* Rate laws for reversible reactions

- We can think of reversible reactions as two reactions going in opposite directions.

- $A + B \rightleftharpoons C + D$ can be thought of as:

1. $A + B \rightarrow C + D$
2. $C + D \rightarrow A + B$

- Each reaction has a forward reaction rate, e.g.:

$r_1 = k_1 C_A C_B$

$r_2 = k_2 C_C C_D$

- Now, to find the rate that species A is "generated" we have:

$r_{1A} = -r_1$ and $r_{2A} = r_2$, and the net rate is $r_A = r_{1A} + r_{2A} = -k_1 C_A C_B + k_2 C_C C_D$.

- At equilibrium, the net rate must be zero, which means:

$k_1 C_{A,eq} C_{B,eq} = k_2 C_{C,eq} C_{D,eq}$

or:

$\frac{k_1}{k_2} = \frac{C_{C,eq} C_{D,eq}}{C_{A,eq} C_{B,eq}} = K_{eq}$

- You can see that between $k_1$, $k_2$ and $K_{eq}$, only two of them are independent. i.e. $k_2 = k_1 / K_{eq}$. 

- Thus, we may also see net reaction rates for equilibrium reaction rates written as:

$r_A = k_1(C_A C_B - \frac{C_C C_D}{K_{eq}})$

- It is important that these constraints exist, so that thermodynamics are not violated.

** A CSTR with a reversible reaction

- Recall the water gas shift reaction we discussed before \(H_2O + CO \rightleftharpoons CO_2 + H_2 \). 

- We previously calculated the equilibrium coefficient to be 1.44 at 1000K. 
- Assume the reaction is elementary, and the forward rate constant is $k_1 = 0.02$ L / (mol * s)

- The reactor is initially fed pure A and B at concentrations of 0.05 mol / L. 

- What is the exit concentration of A? the reactor volume is 10 L, and the volumetric flow rate into the reactor is 0.01 L / s.

- There is less C produced than you would expect from the equilibrium composition
- The reactants are not in the reactor long enough to reach equilibrium

- You can explore this solution. Try using a lower volumetric flow rate, or a larger volume reactor. You will see that the concentrations converge to the equilibrium limit we computed before

* Mole balances with multiple reactions

- There is nothing particularly new in mole balances with multiple reactions

- We still write species based mole balances

- We use the net rate law for each species

- This typically leads to coupled equations
  + For CSTRs these are often coupled nonlinear algebra equations
  + For PFRs these are often coupled differential equations

** Multiple reactions in a CSTR
- We consider a reactor design with multiple reactions
- Mesitylene (trimethyl benzene) can be hydrogenated to form m-xylene, which can be further hydrogenated to toluene

- The reactions we consider are:

\begin{align}
M + H_2 \rightarrow X + CH_4 \\
X + H_2 \rightarrow T + CH_4
\end{align}

- The reaction is carried out isothermally at 1500 $^\circ$ R at 35 atm.
- The feed is 2/3 hydrogen and 1/3 mesitylene
- The volumetric feed rate is 476 cubic feet per hour and the reactor volume is 238 cubic feet
- The rate laws are

\begin{align}
r_1 = k_1 C_M C_H^{0.5} \\
r_2 = k_2 C_X C_H^{0.5}
\end{align}

- The rate constants are:
\begin{align}
k_1 = 55.20 \textrm{(ft$^3$/lb mol)$^{0.5}$/h} \\
k_2 = 30.20 \textrm{(ft$^3$/lb mol)$^{0.5}$/h} \\
\end{align}

Here is the code we need to setup and solve this problem.

- You can see that the basic approach is the same as for a single reaction
  + the code is just /a lot/ longer

- In this example it was not necessary to compute the total molar flow. Inspection shows that it is a constant. Hence, the volumetric flow is also constant.
