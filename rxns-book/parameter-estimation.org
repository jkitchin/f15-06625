* Parameter estimation and rate law determination

- The rate constants in rate laws generally must be determined from experiments

- We typically fit models to experimental data, and derive the rate constants from the fitted parameters

- There are two general types of fitting
  - linear regression
    - fitting models that are linear in the parameters

  - nonlinear regression
    - fitting models that are nonlinear in the parameters

- In either case we want to estimate the value of the parameters in the model, and the uncertainty in the parameters

** Linear regression review

- In linear regression we fit a model that is linear in the parameters to some data.

- The model parameters may be directly useful, e.g. the slope of a line may be related to a rate constant, or we may use the model to derive something, e.g. the derivative at some value.

- A linear model is one like:
\( y = p_0 + p_1 f_1(x) + p_2 f_2(x) + \cdots \)

- Here the parameters are $p_i$ and the model is linear in them.
- The functions $f_i(x)$ do not have to be linear
- Some examples are:
  + \( y = p_0 + p_1 x \) - a line
  + \( y = p_0 + p_1 x + p_2 x^2 \) - a parabola
  + \( y = p_0 + p_1 e^x \)

- We will write these in the general matrix algebra form:
\( \bf{y} = \bf{X} \bf{p} \)

where:
\begin{equation}
\bf{y} = \left [
\begin{array}{c}
y_1 \\
y_2 \\
\vdots \\
y_n\\
\end{array}
\right ]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\bf{X} = \left [ \begin{array}{cccc}
f_n(x_1) & \cdots & f_1(x_1) & 1 \\
f_n(x_2) & \cdots & f_1(x_2) & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots   & \vdots   & \vdots \\
f_n(x_n) & \cdots & f_1(x_n) & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right ]
\end{equation}

and \( \bf{p} = \left [\begin{array}{c}p_n \\ p_{n-1} \\ \vdots \\ p_0 \end{array} \right ]  \)

- The model will usually not fit data perfectly, so we modify the model to include the errors

\(\bf{y} = \bf{X} \bf{p} + \bf{e} \)

- We want the best estimate for *p*, which means we want the  *p* that minimizes the error in the least squares sense (that is the magnitude of the sum of squared errors is minimized)

- The best estimate for *p* is:

\( \bf{p} = (\bf{X}^T\bf{X})^{-1}\bf{X}^T \bf{y} \)

- There will typically be errors between the data and model with corresponding uncertainty in the estimated parameters

- We need to quantify the uncertainty to determine how important it is in reactor design

Let us consider an example. We want to fit a line to the following data. The line has an equation $y = p_0 x + p_1$.

- Remember
\( \bf{p} = (\bf{X}^T\bf{X})^{-1}\bf{X}^T \bf{y} \)

Here we solve a prototypical problem of fitting a line to some data. We are given some x and y data, and we want to fit a line.

- You should always plot the fitted function over the data to visually assess the quality of the fit

[[./images/la-line-fit.png]]
\begin{exercise}
Redo the last example by defining a function to calculate the summed squared error between the model and data, and use fmin to minimize the summed squared error. Show that you get the same parameters.
\end{exercise}

- The error in the fit is defined as: $\bf{e} = \bf{y} - \bf{X}\cdot \bf{p}$

- We can compute the summed squared error as $SSE = \bf{e} \cdot \bf{e}$
- We define $SST = \sum (\bf{y} - \overline{y})^2 = (\bf{y} - \overline{y})\cdot(\bf{y} - \overline{y})$

- We can use that to compute $R^2 = 1 - SSE/SST$ which roughly corresponds to the fraction of variance in the data explained by the model.

- Let us calculate the R^2 value.

: R-squared = 0.99999729149

- The R^2 tells you how much of the variation in the data is explained by the model.
  - a value of 1 tells you all the variation is explained
  - values less than one means the model is incomplete in some way
  - Here the value is close to one, which suggests a good fit

- It is important to consider the uncertainty on the parameters

- pycse has a =regress= function for that
  - We specify a confidence level, typically 95%
  - \alpha = (100 - %confidence level)/100
  - Let us apply that to the same data set

pydoc:pycse.regress

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from pycse import regress
import numpy as np
x = np.array([0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 10])
y = np.array([0, -0.157, -0.315, -0.472, -0.629, -0.942, -1.255, -1.884, -3.147])

X = np.column_stack([x, x**0])

# Choose 95% confidence level
alpha = 1 - 0.95
p, pint, se = regress(X, y, alpha)
slope_interval, intercept_interval = pint

print('The slope is between {0} \n'
      'at the 95% confidence level'.format(slope_interval))

print('The intercept is between {0} \n'
      'at the 95% confidence level'.format(intercept_interval))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The slope is between [-0.31500091 -0.31404346]
: at the 95% confidence level
: The intercept is between [-0.00144683  0.00269598]
: at the 95% confidence level

- Note in this case that the second parameter includes 0
  - We cannot conclude that this parameter is significant.
  - A simpler model with the intercept fixed at 0 might be better

- The size of the confidence intervals depends on the number of data points, the number of estimated parameters, and the confidence level.

Read the [[https://github.com/jkitchin/pycse/blob/master/pycse/PYCSE.py#L7][regress]] source code to learn how the confidence intervals are calculated.

** Applications in determining a rate constant and reaction order

- Rate constants and reaction orders are determined by using models that are fit to experimental data

- A common case is to monitor concentration vs. time in a constant volume, batch reactor

- We consider the disappearance of $A$

- From the mole balance we know:
\(\frac{dN_A}{dt} = r_A V\)

- Let us assume the rate law is of the form: $r_A = k C_A^\alpha$ and a constant volume so that:
\(\frac{dC_A}{dt} = -k C_A^\alpha \)

- Let us be loose with mathematics, rearrange the equation, and take the log of both sides.
  - By loose I mean we take logs of quantities that are not dimensionless

\( \ln(-\frac{dC_A}{dt}) = \ln{k} + \alpha \ln C_A \)

- This suggests that if we could numerically compute $\frac{dC_A}{dt}$ from our data of $C_A(t)$ then a plot of the log of the negative derivative vs the log of concentration would have
  - an intercept equal to the log of the rate constant, $k$
  - and a slope equal to the reaction order $\alpha$

- Given the following data, determine the reaction order in A and the rate constant with 95% confidence intervals.

- We will use the =pycse.deriv= function to numerically compute centered 2-point finite difference approximations to the derivatives
- This works best when the $x$ points are evenly spaced, and they should be monotically increasing or decreasing

pydoc:pycse.deriv

Read the [[https://github.com/jkitchin/pycse/blob/master/pycse/PYCSE.py#L182][deriv]] source code to learn how the derivatives are approximated, and what options are available.

- Note that we are actually using the data in table ref:tab-data in this code block!

- We do not have to type the data in ourselves.

- This causes some false reporting in pyflakes.

[[./images/regression-rate.png]]

- You can see there is a reasonably large range of values for the rate constant and reaction order (although the confidence interval does not contain zero)

- The fit looks ok, but you can see the errors are not exactly random
  - There seems to be systematic trends in a sigmoidal shape of the data
  - That suggests small inadequacy in the model

- Let us examine some methods of evaluating the quality of fit

- First we examine the residuals, or the errors between the data and the model.

- In a good fit, these will be randomly distributed

- In a less good fit, there will be trends

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/regression-residuals.png]]

- You can see there are trends in this data
  - That means the model may not be complete

- There is uncertainty in the data
  - In each concentration measurement there is uncertainty in the time and value of concentration
  - You need more data to reduce the uncertainty
  - You may also need better data to reduce the uncertainty

- Derivatives tend to /magnify/ errors in data
  - The method we used to fit the data contributed to the uncertainty

- We also /nonlinearly/ transformed the errors by taking logs and exp of the data and results, which may have skewed the confidence limits


*** Hybrid methods for data analysis

- Numerical differentiation is noisy, but does the least amount of data manipulation, e.g. smoothing

- Let us consider some hybrid approaches

- The first hybrid method is to fit a polynomial to the Ca(t) data, and then analytically differentiate the polynomial

- You must use some judgment about what order polynomial to fit
  - Judgment comes from experience

pydoc:numpy.polyfit  Fit a polynomial to data

pydoc:numpy.polyder  Get the derivative of a polynomial

pydoc:numpy.polyval  Evaluate a polynomial at some data points

[[./images/poly-regression-rate.png]]

- Note the confidence intervals are tighter
- That is because the polynomial fitting smooths some of the errors out
- We still have nonlinearly transformed errors which may skew the confidence intervals

** Nonlinear regression review

- Nonlinear models are abundant in reaction engineering
  - \(r = k C_A^n \) is linear in the $k$ parameter, and nonlinear in $n$

- Nonlinear fitting is essentially a non-linear optimization problem

- Unlike linear regression, where we directly compute the parameters using matrix algebra, we have to provide an initial guess and iterate to the solution

- Similar to using fsolve, we must define a function of the model
  - The function takes an independent variable, and parameters, f(x,a,b,...)
  - The function should return a value of $y$ for every value of $x$
  - i.e. it should be vectorized

- It is possible to formulate these problems as nonlinear minimization of summed squared errors. See [[http://jkitchin.github.io/blog/2013/02/18/Nonlinear-curve-fitting/][this example]].

- The function =scipy.optimize.curve_fit= provides nonlinear fitting of models (functions) to data.

pydoc:scipy.optimize.curve_fit

- Here is an example usage.
#+BEGIN_SRC python

- Again, you should always visually inspect the fit

Practice: Repeat this last example by creating a function that calculates the summed squared errors between a model function and the data. Use fmin to find the parameters that minimizes the summed squared error.

- We also need to estimate uncertainties in nonlinear parameters

- =pycse= provides a function for this: =nlinfit=.

Here is an example usage of nlinfit.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

from pycse import nlinfit

x = np.array([0.5, 0.387, 0.24, 0.136, 0.04, 0.011])

def func(x, a, b):
    'nonlinear function in a and b to fit to data'
    return a * x / (b + x)

initial_guess = [1.2, 0.03]
alpha = 0.05
pars, pint, se = nlinfit(func, x, y, initial_guess, alpha)

aint, bint = np.array(pint)
print('The 95% confidence interval on a is {0}'.format(aint))
print('The 95% confidence interval on b is {0}'.format(bint))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The 95% confidence interval on a is [ 1.301  1.355]
: The 95% confidence interval on b is [ 0.024  0.029]

- Here the two intervals are relatively small, and do not include zero, suggesting both parameters are significant.

- More importantly, the errors are not skewed by a nonlinear transformation.

- Note you have to provide an initial guess.
  - This will not always be easy to guess.
