* Engineering applications of mole balances

- So far you have learned to design a variety of reactors with single reactions occurring in them

- Usually, we need additional information to tell us which reactor design is better, e.g. a larger volume with low volumetric flow rate vs. a smaller volume with higher volumetric flow rate

- That information may be the cost of different configurations, or the profit from different configurations

** Total cost example

- Let us consider a simple model for the total cost of an operation

- Let the total cost be the operating cost of the reactor plus the cost of the feedstocks

- The operating cost of a reactor can be determined by amortizing the reactor cost over some length of time, and adding the cost required for maintenance, and paying workers.
  - The units of this cost will usually be $/volume/time
  - The cost of operating the reactor then is $C_R = V_R operating_{cost}$

- Feedstock costs are related to the cost of raw materials times the rate at which they are consumed
  - The cost associated with each reactant will be $C_{j} = F_j reactant_{cost}$ if $reactant_{cost}$ is in $/mol.

- Let us consider an example

- Y is produced at a rate of 90 kmol/min in a CSTR by the reaction $X \rightarrow Y$ at a reaction rate of $r = 0.1 C_X$ (kmol/m^3/min)  with an inlet concentration of $C_{X0} = 1.5$ kmol/m^3.  The reactant X costs \$1.20 per kmol. The cost of the reactor is \$0.1 per minute per cubic meter. If we discard unreacted X, what is the minimum cost of making Y?

- We need to know the volume and volumetric flow that will minimize the total cost.

- We have a mole balance on X:

\begin{align}
0 = F_{X0} - F_X + r_X V \\
0 = F_{X0} * C_X v_0 - k C_X V
\end{align}

- We have two unknowns and one equation, but if we specify one variable, we can solve for the other one

- Let us start by specifying a $v_0$, and solving for $V$
- Then we calculate the cost

- Then we vary $v_0$ to minimize the cost

- There are some bounds on $v_0$: We must have at least 90 kmol/min of X entering the reactor to produce 90 kmol/min of Y
  - Actually that would be a conversion of 100%, which is not reasonable.
  - Let us assume 90% conversion is acceptable for now, which means v_0 must be at least 100 kmol/min / 1.5 mol/m^3 \approx 66 m^3/min.

- The cost at low volumetric flow is dominated by the increasing reactor size

- The cost at high volumetric flow is dominated by the cost of the feedstock $X$

Show that the costs in the example above are dominated by reactor volume at low flowrate, and reactant cost at high flowrate.

** Profit example
- Now, let us consider profit

- Profit is the difference between the value of the products and the cost to make them

- Say compound X with a concentration of 2.5 kmol / m^3 flows at a rate of 12 m^3/min into a tubular reactor where it is converted to $Y$.

- The reaction occurs at a rate of $r = 30.0 C_X$ mol/m^3/min

- $Y$ has a value $V_Y$ of $1.50 / kmol, and the cost of reactor operation $C_R$ is $2.50 per minute per m^3.

- What is the maximum profit?

- The value of the products will be $F_Y V_Y$ and the operating cost will be $V_R C_R$.

- We have to compute the exit molar flow of product as a function of reactor volume, and then compute the profit for each volume.

- Here we set up mole balances on $X$ and $Y$.
  - It is not strictly necessary, we could just get $F_X$, and compute $F_Y$ by stoichiometry later
  - Instead, we compute $F_Y$ in the solution

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/profit.png]]

- You can see a maximum in profit at a reactor volume of about 1.5 m^3.

- To get a more quantitative answer, we need to use optimization

- We need to define an objective function to minimize

- The profit goes through a maximum, so -profit will go through a minimum

- We will use an optional argument to our profit function that determines the sign of the return value
  - For the optimization we set the sign to be -1
  - After we have a solution we use the default sign of +1 to compute the profit
  - This is just for convenience. You could multiply by \pm 1 as needed.

- The point of these examples is to illustrate how to combine mole balance and reactor design equations with additional information to help select the best design
  - You may want to minimize total cost
  - or maximize profit

- Other applications might be finding operating conditions to avoid certain pressure increases, or minimizing a pressure drop
