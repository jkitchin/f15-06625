* Parameter estimation from differential equation based models

- Finally,  we consider fitting the mole balance directly

- Here we numerically integrate the mole balance with parameters that we want to estimate
- We use nlinfit to vary the parameters and "fit" the data

- We need the ODE function which is integrated

- We need another model function which integrates the ODE with a set of parameters and returns the estimated data points at the same time values

- Then we let nlinfit do its work.

#+RESULTS:
: alpha = [ 2.002  2.071] at the 95% confidence level
: k = [ 0.126  0.159] at the 95% confidence level

- The confidence intervals here are identical to the nonlinear fit to the analytical solution!

- We have essentially solved the same fitting problem

- Notice again that initial guesses were required

* Effects of uncertainty on reactor design

- The effects of uncertainty in parameters on design are a result of propagation of errors.

- If there is uncertainty in a number, and that number is used to calculate another number, then the result will have uncertainty also

- We can quantitatively determine the uncertainty and how it is propagated

- see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty][propagation of uncertainty]].

If a function depends on parameters (a, b, c ...) that have corresponding uncertainties (\sigma_a, \sigma_b, \sigma_c,...) then the uncertainty in $f$ is approximately:

\(s_f = \sqrt{\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial a}\right)^2 s_a^2 + \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial b}\right)^2 s_b^2  + \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial c}\right)^2 s_c^2 + \cdots}  \)


- Consider we have a parameter k=0.1 1/s with standard error of \sigma_k = 0.02, i.e. $k = 0.1 \pm 0.02$ 1/s.

- If the rate law is $r = k C_A$, and there is no uncertainty in $C_A$, what is the uncertainty in the rate for $C_A=2$?

\( \sigma_r = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial r}{\partial k}\right)^2\sigma_k^2} \)

- Evaluating this leads to \sigma_r = C_A \sigma_k = 0.04
- In other words, the rate will be 0.2 \pm 0.04 mol/L/s

- It can be tedious to evaluate all of the partial derivatives
- The =uncertainties= package can help tremendously for this

pydoc:uncertainties

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import uncertainties as u

k = u.ufloat(0.1, 0.02)
CA = 2.0

print('The rate is {0} mol/L/s'.format(k*CA))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The rate is 0.20+/-0.04 mol/L/s

- =uncertainties= automatically propagates most errors through all standard math operations, and many (but not all) functions.

- An alternative approach to error propagation is Monte Carlo simulation.

- In this approach we sample the variables with uncertainty and perform the calculations many times.

- Then we use statistical analysis to determine the uncertainty of the result.

- We illustrate the approach on estimating the uncertainty

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

N = 10000
muk = 0.1
sigmak = 0.02
k = np.random.normal(muk, sigmak, N)

CA = 2.0

r = k * CA
print('The average rate is {0} mol/L/s'.format(np.mean(r)))
print('The standard error is {0} mol/L/s'.format(np.std(r)))

#+RESULTS:
: The average rate is 0.199960144804 mol/L/s
: The standard error is 0.0401118783871 mol/L/s

[[./images/mc-error.png]]

- You can see that the distribution appears approximately normally distributed

- The average is approximately the same as we observed in the previous two approaches

- The standard error is also approximately the same

- This approach makes no assumptions about the error propagation other than errors in the parameters are not correlated
  - we do assume the uncertainty in the parameters is normally distributed
  - Other distributions could also be used

- Note it is possible with the normal distribution for $k$ to be negative
  - This is not physically meaningful
  - The probability of that happening is very low
  - $k$ is only approximately normally distributed about the mean, not in the tails

Let us illustrate the effects of uncertainty on the exit concentration of a CSTR.

- $r_A = k C_A^2$ with $k$ = 3.0 \pm 0.2 L/mol/hr
- $A$ is fed to the reactor at a rate of 5 \pm 0.05 mol/hr
- The volumetric flow is 10 \pm 0.1 L/hr
- The reactor volume is 66000 L

What is the exit concentration?

- We have to solve $0 = F_{A,in} - F_{A,out} + r_A V$

- We have several variables to create distributions for. We will create all the samples, and then loop through them and store the result in a vector.

import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

N = 10000    # number of MC samples
V =  66000   # L

Fa0 = np.random.normal(5, 0.05, (1, N))
v0 = np.random.normal(10.0, 0.1, (1, N))
k = np.random.normal(3.0, 0.2, (1, N))

# create the array to store the results in
# It is usually more efficient to create arrays then fill them in.
SOL = np.empty(k.shape)

for i in range(N):
    def func(Ca):
        ra = -k[0,i] * Ca**2
        return Fa0[0,i] - v0[0,i] * Ca + V * ra
    guess = 0.1 * Fa0[0,i] / v0[0,i]  # guessing 90% conversion
    SOL[0,i] = fsolve(func, guess)[0]

print('Ca(exit) = {0}+/-{1}'.format(np.mean(SOL), np.std(SOL)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Ca(exit) = 0.00500841311873+/-0.000170134641306

- This analysis shows there is about 2% uncertainty in the exit concentration
  - that may be acceptable

- It is not fast to do Monte Carlo
  - you need many calculations to get good statistics
  - In some cases you may find not all calculations converge

- We can also use the =uncertainties= package
  - We have to do some work to make it work
  - We have to "wrap" the fsolve function to make it work with uncertainties
  - but after that, evaluation is fast

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import uncertainties as u
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

V = 66000  # reactor volume L^3
Fa0 = u.ufloat(5.0, 0.05)     # mol / h
v0 = u.ufloat(10., 0.1)       # L / h
k = u.ufloat(3.0, 0.2)      # rate constant L/mol/h

# Step 1
def func(Ca, v0, k, Fa0, V):
    "Mole balance for a CSTR. Solve this equation for func(Ca)=0"
    Fa = v0 * Ca     # exit molar flow of A
    ra = -k * Ca**2  # rate of reaction of A L/mol/h
    return Fa0 - Fa + V * ra

# Step 2
def Ca_solve(v0, k, Fa0, V):
    'wrap fsolve to pass parameters as float or units'
    # this line is a little fragile. You must put [0] at the end or
    # you get the NotImplemented result
    guess = 0.1 * Fa0 / v0
    sol = fsolve(func, guess, args=(v0, k, Fa0, V))[0]
    return sol

# Step 3
Ca_exit = u.wrap(Ca_solve)(v0, k, Fa0, V)
print('The exit concentration is {0}'.format(Ca_exit))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The exit concentration is 0.00500+/-0.00017

- You can see this result is very similar to our Monte Carlo analysis
- Some disadvantages for this approach are
  - The need to wrap functions
  - You cannot perform statistical analysis on the results
    - This may be important in very nonlinear equations where standard error propagation formulas are not good approximations
- This simulation assumes the uncertainties in parameters are uncorrelated, i.e. they are independent

* Differential flow reactors for determining rate laws

- For many reactions it is not feasible to perform batch reactions
- Especially for gas phase reactions on catalysts, a flow reactor is preferrable
- If we can use a packed bed reactor with an approximately differential (i.e. a small thickness), then it is possible to directly measure the rate of reaction

\( \frac{dF_A}{dW} = r_A \)

- We approximate the rate as:

\( r_A \approx \frac{F_{A,exit} - F_{A0}}{W_b} \)

 where $W_b$ is the weight of the bed, $F_{A,exit} = \nu C_A$ is the molar flow of $A$ out of the reactor, and $F_{A0}$ is the molar flow entering the reactor

- It is important that $W_b$ is small, to keep the total conversion as small as possible while still being able to measure changes in the molar flows
  - Low total conversion is important so you can assume $C_A$ is essentially constant in the reactor bed

- Instead of measuring a small change in the reactants, you may also measure the increase in molar flow rate of products, which increase from zero (assuming they are not in the feed)

- In this reactor setup, you measure $r_A$ as a function of inlet conditions, and then fit the data to a proposed rate law

- Here is an example of rate data from a differential reactor as a function of inlet concentration of $A$
  - We assume that $r_1 = k C_A^\alpha$ and fit the model to the data
