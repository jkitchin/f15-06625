* Semi-batch reactor

- A semi-batch reactor is in between a batch reactor and a CSTR.
- A typical operation is that the reactor is initially full of one reactant, and one adds the second reactant slowly
- There is usually no outlet flow, so the volume of the reactor is not constant
- It is a transient reactor

- The main reason to use a semi-batch reactor is to control reaction rate by slowly adding reactants in the feed stream
- Assuming that $B$ is the species fed to the reactor
- The mole balance becomes:
\( \frac{d(N_B)}{dt} = \nu C_B + r_A V \)

- All other species mole balances are the same as the batch reactor
  - /except/ that we need to account for the changing volume on the concentrations in the rate laws

- Note, we need an equation for how the volume changes now too.
- If the density is not a function of composition, we have $V = V_0 + \nu_0 t$
  - or alternatively: $\frac{dV}{dt} = \nu_0$

- Let us consider an example of $A + B \rightarrow C$
- We start with 5 L of $A$ at a concentration of 2 mol/L in a 10 L reactor
- We add $B$ at a rate of $0.1 L / min$ at a concentration of 2 mol/L
- The rate law is given as $r = k C_A C_B^2$ with $k = 0.02$ L^2/mol^2/hr
- Find the concentration of A when the reactor is full.
- The mole balance on $A$ is:

\( \frac{d N_A}{dt} = r_A V\)
  - with $N_A(t=0) = V_0 C_{A0}$

- on $B$ we have
\(\frac{d N_B}{dt} = v_0 C_{B0} + r_B  V\)
  - with $N_B(t=0) = 0$

- Assuming no change in density we have
\( \frac{dV}{dt} = v_0 \)
   - with $V(t=0) = 5$ L

- we only have 5 L of available volume, which will take 50 minutes to fill at 0.1 L/min

- Compute the final concentrations of A and B after 50 minutes.

- How much $A$ was actually converted?
  - $C_A$ will go down simply by dilution! We double the volume, which would cut $C_A$ in half even with no reaction

- Initially we had 10 mol of A
- Finally we have \approx 7.4 mol
  - The difference is what reacted

- Semibatch reactors are most often used when there are multiple reactions present, and it is advantageous to control the rate by slowly adding one reactant.


* Membrane reactors

- A membrane reactor is typically like a plug flow reactor, but one reactant selectively passes across the membrane into the reactor, or a product selectively passes across the membrane, out of the reactor.

[[./images/membrane-reactor.png]]

- The mole balance is similar to the [[id:CC6133A5-FAC8-4C09-8AE5-584E9C8278E9][plug flow reactor]]

- We need a new term in our mole balance because there is an additional flow of material into the reactor

- We consider the differential volume again, and in the limit of $\Delta V \rightarrow 0$ we have to know the flux across the surface of the membrane per unit volume.

\( \frac{dF_A}{dV} = r_A + R_A  \)

  - where $R_A$ will be an expression for the flux across the membrane per unit volume of the reactor.

- Similar to the case where we had a pressure drop, we need a model that describes the flux across the membrane
  - This requires some knowledge of the transport process across the membrane
  - For diffusion we might choose $R_A = a k_{c,A}(C_{A,s} - C_A)$
     - where $C_A$ is the concentration of $A$ in the reactor, and $C_{A,s}$ is the concentration of $A$ outside the reactor.
     - If $C_{A,s} > C_A$ there is a net flux of $A$ into the reactor
     - $a$ is the surface area per unit volume (for a tubular reactor, $a=4/D$)
     - k_{c,A} is an overall mass transfer coefficient in m/s

- Since we have a situation where the molar flow is changing down the length of the reactor due to transport and reaction, we have to consider the effect on the volumetric flowrate and concentrations

- Let us consider a single reaction, $A \rightarrow B + C$, where $B$ is permeable to the walls of the reactor, and diffuses out.
- let $k = 0.7$ 1/min, $k_b' = k_b a =  0.2$ 1/min
- let $-r_A = k C_A$
- the inlet molar flow is 10 mol/min at a concentration of 0.2 mol/L
- Assume that the outside of the reactor is swept by an inert gas, so $C_{B,s} = 0$.
- Estimate the exit concentrations at V = 400 L

- We cannot simply relate the species by stoichiometry here, because the molar flow of $B$ is affected by reaction and transport.
- We need a mole balances for each species
- For species that doe not cross the membrane, we use the same mole balance as a PFR.

- What you can see here is that $F_C$ and $F_A$ can be related by stoichiometry:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
Fa0 = 10.0
Fa_exit = 0.235923526517
xi = (Fa_exit - Fa0) / -1  # reaction extent

Fc_exit = xi * 1  # extent * stoichiometry
print(Fc_exit)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 9.76407647348

- However, $F_B$ cannot be related by stoichiometry (or reaction extent) because it also changes by transport across the reactor walls

- This is an introduction to the membrane reactor
- Where the membrane reactor has real impact is when multiple reactions are present, and selectivity is important.
- Membrane reactors are especially helpful in cases where equilibrium limits exist

- We will see more of these in future lectures.
