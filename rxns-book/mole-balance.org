* Simple mole balances
** Review of the mole balance
- *Mole* balances are performed for a /species/ in a control volume

#+attr_org: :width 300
[[./images/mole-balance.png]]

\begin{align}
Accumulation &=& In - Out + Generation \\
\frac{dN_J}{dt} &=& F_{J0} - F_J + V r_J
\end{align}

- Here we use the convention that $N_j$ refers to the total number of moles of species $J$ in the volume, $F_J$ is a molar flow of $J$, and $r_J$ is the intensive rate of production of $J$, and it has a negative magnitude if species $J$ is in fact being consumed.

Now, we consider specific examples. We will go in order of mathematical difficulty:

- steady state, (non)linear algebraic
- ordinary differential equations

** A continuously stirred tank reactor
index:cstr

Here is the typical schematic diagram of a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR).

#+attr_org: :width 300
[[./images/constant-volume-cstr.png]]

- We assume the tank is well-mixed because it is well-stirred
- The concentration at the exit is the same as everywhere in the tank
- The mole balance at steady state (\(\frac {dN_A}{dt} = 0) \) is:

\(0 = F_{A0} - F_A + V r_A \)

** A continuously stirred tank reactor problem

- We have a 10L stirred tank reactor
- $A$ flows in at a molar flow rate of 1 mol/hr and volumetric flowrate of 2.5 L/hr
- $-r_A = k C_A$, $k = 0.23$ 1/hr
- What is the steady-state exit concentration of $A$?

- The equations

\begin{align}
\frac{dN_A}{dt} = 0 &=& F_{A0} - F_A + V r_A \\
                  0 &=& F_{A0} - F_A  - V k C_{A, exit} \\
                  0 &=& F_{A0} - v_0 C_{A, exit} - V  k C_{A, exit}
\end{align}

\(C_{A, exit} = \frac{F_{A0}}{v_0 + V k}\)

- Only for constant volume
- Assumes well-mixed, i.e. uniform concentration

** Solving the problem with algebra (CSTR)

- Simple algebra

#+name: cstr
#+BEGIN_SRC python
k = 0.23  # 1/hr
Fa0 = 1.0 # mol /hr
v0 = 2.5  # L /hr
V = 10    # L

Ca_exit = (Fa0 / (v0 + V * k))
print('Ca_exit = {0:1.3f} mol / L'.format(Ca_exit))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: cstr
: Ca_exit = 0.208 mol / L

- This was an easy problem, but the algebraic manipulations are all possible places where errors can be made.
- Let us consider a numerical approach

** Solving the problem numerically using a solver (CSTR)

- We have to create a function that is equal to zero at the solution.
  + We have that directly from the mole balance:

    $0 = F_{A0} - F_A + V r_A$

  + We just have to make sure to use the correct variables, with correct units.

- We use a nonlinear solver, so we also have to provide an initial guess. You may want to review pydoc:scipy.optimize.fsolve

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

k = 0.23   # 1/hr
Fa0 = 1.0  # mol /hr
v0 = 2.5   # L /hr
V = 10     # L

def func(Ca):
    ra = -k * Ca
    Fa = v0 * Ca
    return Fa0 - Fa  + V * ra

guess = 1.0  # mol / L
ans, = fsolve(func, guess) # note the comma after ans. That "unpacks" the array

print('Ca_exit = {0} mol/L'.format(ans))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Ca_exit = 0.208333333333 mol/L

- This had less manipulation, and fewer opportunities for mistakes
- On the other hand, we ended up using a solver that required an initial guess to solve a linear problem.
- This was a simple problem, but other problems will not be linear, and will be much more difficult.
- Remember what the units are? Were they consistent?

** Solving the problem with units (CSTR)
index:units

- Units are not built-in to python
- We have to install the =quantities= package
- Then import the package so we can use it

In case you have not installed it already:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from setuptools.command import easy_install

for pkg in ['pycse', 'quantities', 'pint',
            'uncertainties', 'jedi', 'rope']:
    easy_install.main(['-U', pkg])
#+END_SRC

Now we consider units.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import quantities as u
k = 0.23 * 1/u.hr
Fa0 = 1.0 * u.mol / u.hr
v0 = 2.5 * u.L / u.hr
V = 10 * u.L

Cae = Fa0 / (v0 + V * k)
print('Ca,exit = {0}'.format(Cae))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Ca,exit = 0.208333333333 mol/L

- This has printed with too many significant figures, but it is not easy to change that
- =quantities= is great for simple problems
- There are limitations we will see later
- You build up experience on when to use this, or not

** Solving the problem with uncertainty (CSTR)
index:uncertainty

- Uncertainty analysis is not built in to python
- We have to install the =uncertainties= package and import it

Let us assume there is some uncertainty in the rate constant, say it is $k = 0.23 \pm 0.1$ 1/hr.

  - Is that a lot of uncertainty?

We can use the =uncertainties= package to propagate that error automatically.

pydoc:uncertainties.ufloat

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import uncertainties as u

k = u.ufloat(0.23, 0.1)   # rate constant 1/hr
Fa0 = 1.0                 # inlet molar flow mol/hr
v0 = 2.5                  # volumetric flow L/hr
V = 10                    # reactor volume L
Cae = Fa0 / (v0 + V * k)
print('Ca,exit = {0}'.format(Cae))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Ca,exit = 0.21+/-0.04

- =uncertainties= is also great for simple problems
- We have to do some work to make it work in other situations

* Mole balance on a batch reactor
 index:batch

The next more complex (mathematically) mole balance is the batch reactor. The batch reactor does not operate at steady state, and therefore we have an ordinary differential equation that describes the number of moles in the reactor as a function of time.

#+attr_org: :width 200
[[./images/constant-volume-batch.png]]

- Constant volume
- No flow in or out

\( \frac{dN_A}{dt} = V r_A \)

** Simple application of a mole balance to a constant volume batch reactor

- At $t=0$ we have an initial concentration of 2 mol/L
- $-r_A = k C_A$ with $k = 0.23$ 1/hr
- How much A is left after 1 hour?

- Equations

\begin{align}
N_A &=& C_A V \\
\frac{dN_A}{dt} &=& V \frac{dC_A}{dt} \\
\frac{dC_A}{dt} &=& r_A = -k C_A \\
C_A(t=0) &=& C_{A0}
\end{align}

- Only for constant volume
- Assumes well-mixed, i.e. uniform concentration
- Initial condition, ordinary differential equation

** Solving the problem (constant volume batch reactor)

We have an ordinary differential equation with an initial condition. We need to integrate it from t=0 to t=1 hour, and then get the solution at t=1 hour.

pydoc:scipy.integrate.odeint

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint

k = 0.23   # 1/hr
Ca0 = 2.0  # mol / L

def ode(Ca, t):
    dCadt = -k * Ca
    return dCadt

tspan = np.linspace(0, 1)  # hours
sol = odeint(ode, Ca0,  tspan)

# sol is a 2d array. It has as many rows as tspan, and as many columns as Ca0
print(type(sol), sol.shape)

# We want the last value of sol, which is in the last row, column 0
print('C_A at t = 1 hour = {0} mol/L'.format(sol[-1, 0]))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: <type 'numpy.ndarray'> (50, 1)
: C_A at t = 1 hour = 1.58906722836 mol/L

- Remember what the units are?

** Plotting $C_A$ vs. time in a batch reactor

- Now let us solve the ODE and plot the solution.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

k = 0.23   # 1 / hr
Ca0 = 2.0  # mol / L

def ode(Ca, t):
    dCadt = -k * Ca
    return dCadt

tspan = np.linspace(0, 1)
sol = odeint(ode, Ca0,  tspan)

# Note: tspan is a 1d array, and sol is a 2d array. numpy understands these
# arrays are compatible based on their sizes and shapes.
print('shapes: ',tspan.shape, sol.shape)

plt.plot(tspan, sol)
plt.xlabel('Time (hours)')
plt.ylabel('$C_A$ (mol / L)')
plt.savefig('images/batch-time.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ('shapes: ', (50,), (50, 1))

[[./images/batch-time.png]]

- $C_A$ decreases with time (it is consumed)
- It is not apparent from this graph because of the short time, but the concentration decreases exponentially with time (plot for longer time to see it).

* Mole balance in a plug flow reactor
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       CC6133A5-FAC8-4C09-8AE5-584E9C8278E9
  :END:

  index:pfr
- In the plug flow reactor, reactants enter the front of the reactor and disappear as they flow through the reactor

[[./images/pfr-schematic.png]]

- We assume our differential element is well-mixed
- The mole balance on the differential element leads to

\( \frac{dN_A}{dt} = F_A |_V - F_A |_{V + \Delta V} + \Delta V r_A \)

- At steady state, in the limit of $\Delta V \rightarrow 0$ we get:

\( \frac{dF_A}{dV} = r_A \)

- This is an ordinary differential equation (but it varies in space, not time), and to solve it we need an initial condition on the molar flow at $V=0$.

** A worked PFR example

- Given a 100 L reactor with $A$ flowing in at a concentration of 3 mol/L and a rate of 10 L/min
- The reaction $A \rightarrow B$ occurs at a rate law of $r = k C_A$ with $k = 0.23$ 1/min
- What is the exit concentration of $A$?

1. We have \(\frac{dF_A}{dV} = r_A \)
2. We have $r_A = -r$ (stoichiometry)
3. $F_A(V=0) = C_{A0} v_0$


#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import odeint

Ca0 = 3.0  # mol / L
v0 = 10.0  # volumetric flowrate L/min
k = 0.23   # rate constant 1/min

def ode(Fa, V):
    Ca = Fa / v0
    return -k * Ca

Vspan = [0, 100] # reactor volume

sol = odeint(ode, Ca0 * v0, Vspan)
Fa_exit = sol[-1, 0] # last row, column 0

print('Exit concentration = {0:1.4f} mol/L'.format(Fa_exit / v0))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Exit concentration = 0.3008 mol/L

- Our solution only has two points in it: 0 and 100L
  - We cannot visualize the concentration profile



exercise:ex-molbal  finish this in class.



** A harder PFR example

- The reaction $A \rightarrow B$ occurs at a rate law of $r = k C_A$ with $k = 0.23$ 1/min
- If  $A$ is flowing in at a concentration of 3 mol/L and a rate of 10 L/min
- How large should the reactor be to reduce the concentration of $A$ to 0.3 mol/L?

There are many ways to approach this.
- You could integrate $\frac{dF_A}{dV} = r_A$ and graphically determine where the solution is.
- You could setup a numerical approach to solving the equation

- First we graph the solution. the code is almost the same as before, but we integrate over more points and a larger range to get a smooth curve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Ca0 = 3.0 # mol / L
v0 = 10.0 # L / min
k = 0.23  # 1/min

def ode(Fa, V):
    Ca = Fa / v0
    return -k * Ca

Vspan = np.linspace(0, 200) # volumes to integrate over

sol = odeint(ode, Ca0 * v0, Vspan)

plt.plot(Vspan, sol)
plt.xlabel('Volume (L)')
plt.ylabel('$F_A$ (mol/L)')
plt.savefig('images/pfr-volume.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:


[[./images/pfr-volume.png]]

- at $C_A = 0.3$ mol/L, $F_A = 3$ mol/min.
- We know the answer from before: It is about 100 L.
- It is hard to be very accurate this way, although interactive graphics help
- add plt.show() on the last line of the code block above. You should get an interactive graph.

** Numerical solution						   :optional:

- To numerically solve this we must solve a function $f(V) = 0$.
- Here is one approach
- Starting from $\frac{dF_A}{dV} = -k F_A/\nu$ we derive:

\(f(V) = \int_{F_{A0}}^{F_A} \frac{dF_A}{F_A} - \int_{V=0}^{V} \frac{-k}{\nu}dV \)

where everything is known but $V$. We use numerical quadrature to evaluate the integrals.

pydoc:scipy.integrate.quad

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import quad
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

k = 0.23        # 1/min
nu = 10         # L/min
Ca0 = 3.0       # mol / L
Fa0 = Ca0 * nu
Fa = 0.30 * nu

def integrand1(Fa):
    return 1.0 / Fa

def integrand2(V):
    return -k / nu

def func(V):
    I1, e1 = quad(integrand1, Fa0, Fa)
    I2, e2 = quad(integrand2, 0, V)
    return I1 - I2

guess = 120 # Liters
sol = fsolve(func, guess)
print('Volume = {0:1.2f}'.format(float(sol)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Volume = 100.11

- This also leaves something to be desired in complexity
- Many opportunities for mistakes in the derivation
- Requires sophisticated thinking about the problem
- Other approaches require similar or more sophistication!


** Using events to stop integration

- An alternative to the methods above is to use an ODE solver that is aware of events to stop the integration where you want it.

- =pycse= provides a function like this called =odelay=. pydoc:pycse.odelay

- You define an event function that equals zero at the event. You specify if the event is terminal, and whether to the zero must be approached from above or below, or if all zeros count.

- Here is an example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from pycse import odelay

Ca0 = 3.0  # mol / L
v0 = 10.0  # L / min
k = 0.23   # 1 / min

Fa_Exit = 0.3 * v0

def ode(Fa, V):
    Ca = Fa / v0
    return -k * Ca

def event1(Fa, V):
    isterminal = True
    direction = 0
    value = Fa - Fa_Exit
    return value, isterminal, direction

Vspan = np.linspace(0, 200) # L

V, F, TE, YE, IE = odelay(ode, Ca0 * v0, Vspan, events=[event1])

print('Solution is at {0} L'.format(V[-1]))
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(V, F)
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Solution is at 100.112422298 L

- As you can see, there are many ways to solve this problem
- It is /not/ necessary to know every single way to do it, but knowing multiple ways increases your ability to solve other problems in the future
- And provides ways to check your solution by other methods.

** Solution by interpolation					   :optional:

- Solve the problem on a grid
- Create interpolation function for the solution to approximate solutions between grid points.  pydoc:scipy.interpolate.interp1d
- Use fsolve to find the solution

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

Ca0 = 3.0  # mol / L
v0 = 10.0  # L / min
k = 0.23   # 1 / min

def ode(Fa, V):
    'dFa/dV = ra'
    Ca = Fa / v0
    r = k * Ca
    ra = -r
    return ra

Vspan = np.linspace(0, 200) # L

sol = odeint(ode, Ca0 * v0, Vspan)

Ca_exit = 0.3 # mol / L
Fa_exit = Ca_exit * v0

# Note that here we cannot mix 1d and 2d arrays. We must extract a 1d
# array from the solution. We do that with sol[:, 0] which means take
# all rows in column 0.
interp_func = interp1d(Vspan, sol[:, 0], 'cubic')

def objective(V):
    'equal to zero when F(V) = Fa_exit'
    return interp_func(V) - Fa_exit

from scipy.optimize import fsolve
V_sol = fsolve(objective, 100)
print('Solution is at {0} L'.format(float(V_sol)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Solution is at 100.112385849 L

- Note that you may be limited by the accuracy of your interpolation here. Solving the ODE with a fine mesh of points will increase the accuracy of the solution. Or using more accurate interpolations, e.g. splines, can also increase the accuracy.
