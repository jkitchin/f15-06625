* Deriving rate laws from mechanisms

- We now begin considering how complex, non-elementary rate laws are formed

- For the reaction $\ce{(CH_3)_2N_2} \rightarrow \ce{C_2H_6} + \ce{N_2}$ it has been observed that
  - The reaction is first order in reactants at high pressures
  - The reaction is second order in reactants at low pressures
  - In other words, no simple power law kinetic expression can account for a change in reaction order
  - The rate law is *not* $r = k C_A$ for all conditions (especially low pressure)

- We consider the possibility that the reaction occurs by a /mechanism/ of several steps

- These steps will be elementary, so that we can write the rate law for the step by inspection

- Let us consider these steps for the overall reaction $A \rightarrow B + C$

\begin{align*}
2A \rightarrow A + A^*  \\
A^* + A \rightarrow 2A  \\
A^* \rightarrow B + C
\end{align*}

- With these rate laws (because we require these reactions to be elementary)

\begin{align*}
r_1 = k_1 C_A^2 \\
r_2 = k_2 C_A^* C_A \\
r_3 = k_3 C_A^*
\end{align*}

- We have introduced a new species $A^*$, which we refer to as an active intermediate
  - This is a short-lived, reactive species formed by collisions with other molecules

- We cannot readily measure the concentration of $A^*$, which makes it impossible to determine the rate constants for reactions with $A^*$ as a reactant
  - Molecular simulations makes in increasingly possible to estimate these
  - Femtosecond spectroscopy has "observed" some of the intermediates (1999 Nobel Prize)

- Let us assume that $A^*$ is consumed about as fast as it is produced

- The net rate of production will then be approximately zero

\begin{align}
0 &=& r_1 - r_2 - r_3 \\
  &=& k_1 C_A^2 - k_2 C_A^* C_A - k_3 C_A^*
\end{align}

- We can solve for $C_A^* = \frac{k_1 C_A^2}{k_3 + k_2 C_A}$

- Now, we can determine $r_B = k_3 C_A^* = \frac{k_3 k_1 C_A^2}{k_3 + k_2 C_A}$
  - by stoichiometry  $r_A = -k_3 C_A^* = \frac{k_3 k_1 C_A^2}{k_3 + k_2 C_A}$

- For low concentratrations of $A (k_3 \gg k_2 C_A)$ the rate will appear second order in $A$

- For high concentratrations of $A (k_3 \ll k_2 C_A)$ the rate will appear first order in $A$

- Let us review what we did

  1. We /assumed/ or /postulated/ a mechanism of elementary reaction steps involving active intermediates
     - The steps of the mechansim /must/ add up to the overall reaction

  2. We set the net rate of production of the active intermediates to zero and used that to solve for the concentration of the active intermediates

  3. We plugged the concentration of the active intermediate into rate expressions for products (or reactants)

  4. We compared the behavior of the resulting rate law to experimental observations for consistency

- We can say our mechanism is /consistent/ with experimental observations

- This does not prove this is the operating mechanism
  - Other mechanisms may also be consistent
  - Chemistry is concerned with getting this right
  - We may be satisfied we have a rate law that is reasonably accurate over a broad pressure range

- The next step would be fitting the model to data to get numerical estimates of the parameters

- You may construct multiple mechanisms, and derive many rate laws to see which one fits data the best

** An application in ethane cracking

- Adapted from Fogler, 4th ed. Example 7-2 page 387

- Ethane cracks at high temperatures to form hydrogen, ethylene and higher hydrocarbons that are more valuable than ethane

\ce{C_2H_6} $\rightarrow$ \ce{H_2} + \ce{C_2H_4} + other products

- Ethane cracks according to the following mechanism

\begin{align*}
\ce{C_2H_6} \rightarrow 2 \ce{CH_3^{.}} \\
\ce{CH_3^{.}} + \ce{C_2H_6} \rightarrow \ce{CH_4} + \ce{C_2H_5^{.}}  \\
\ce{C_2H_5^{.}} \rightarrow \ce{H^{.}} + \ce{C_2H_4}  \\
\ce{C_2H_6} + \ce{H^{.}} \rightarrow \ce{C_2H_5^{.}} + \ce{H_2} \\
2 \ce{C_2H_5^{.}} \rightarrow \ce{C_4H_{10}}
\end{align*}

  - A = \ce{C_2H_6}
  - B = CH_3^{.}
  - C = C_2H_5^{.}
  - D = H^{.}
  - E = \ce{C_2H_4}

- With these rate laws
\begin{align*}
r_1 = k_1 C_A \\
r_2 = k_2 C_A C_B \\
r_3 = k_3 C_C \\
r_4 = k_4 C_A C_D \\
r_5 = k_5 C_C^2
\end{align*}

- In this mechanism, any species with a $^{.}$ is a radical (a highly reactive intermediate species) whose concentration cannot be easily measured

- We would like an analytical expression for the rate of consumption of ethane, and the rate of production of ethylene

- The rate constants of these particular steps are known:
  - k_1 = 1.5e-3 1/s
  - k_2 = 2.3e6 L/mol/s
  - k_3 = 5.7e5 1/s
  - k_4 = 9.5e8 L/mol/s
  - k_5 = 2.0e9 L/mol/s

- You see immediately that there are orders of magnitude differences in the rate constants
  - These reflect different transition states, changes in entropy, and other factors

- That suggests any set of mole balances would be very stiff

- Let us try to set them up for a batch reactor

- Let the initial concentration of ethane be 0.1 M, and assume constant volume.

- We will need net rates for each species

[[./images/ethane-cracking-1.png]]

- This figure shows that only two species in the equations have significant concentrations
  - Ethane which disappears
  - Ethylene which appears
  - We did not consider the formation of butane, but we could have by adding another mole balance

- All reactive intermediates have very low concentrations

- So low we must look at them on a log scale

[[./images/ethane-cracking-2.png]]

- Thus these radical species are examples of active intermediates

- Let us now proceed to derive a rate law that does not contain an active intermediate species

- We seek an expression for $r_E$
  - $r_E = k_3 C_C$
  - But we need to replace $C_C$ with species that are measurable

- We will set the net rates of each active intermediate to zero

\begin{align}
r_B = 0 &=& 2r_1 - r_2 \\
r_C = 0 &=& r_2 - r_3 - 2r_5 \\
r_D = 0 &=& r_3 - r_4
\end{align}

- Now, we need to solve for each reactive intermediate concentration

- It takes some algebra to arrive at

\begin{align}
C_B &=& \frac{2k_1}{k_2} \\
C_C &=& \left(\frac{k_1}{k_5} C_A \right )^{1/2} \\
C_D &=& \frac{k_3}{k_4}\left(\frac{k_1}{k_5}\right)^{1/2} C_A^{1/2}
\end{align}

- Now we can express the rate of production of ethylene (E) as
\( r_E = k_3 C_C = k_3 \left(\frac{k_1}{k_5} C_A \right )^{1/2} \)

- To use this in a mole balance, we also need $C_A$

\begin{align}
r_A &=& -r_1 - r_2 - r_4 \\
    &=& -k_1 C_A - k_2 C_A C_B - k_4 C_A C_D \\
    &=& -k_1 C_A - k_2 C_A \frac{2k_1}{k_2} - k_4 \frac{k_3}{k_4}\left(\frac{k_1}{k_5}\right)^{1/2} C_A^{-1/2}\\
    &=& -3 k_1 C_A - k_3 \left(\frac{k_1}{k_5} C_A\right)^{1/2}
\end{align}

- Now we have an analytical expression for the rate of consumption of ethane!

- It is complicated, and nonlinear in rate constants

- We probably could not fit 5 parameters to data

- We would normally consider lumping parameters
  - For example, $-r_A = k_1' C_A + k_2' C_A^{1/2}$
  - $k_2' = k_3 \left ( \frac{k_1}{k_5}\right )^{1/2}$

- The lumped parameters are made up of rate constants from elementary steps

[[./images/ethane-cracking-3.png]]

- You can see the concentration profiles for the full model and the derived rate law are visually indistinguishable

- The new rate law does not have any active intermediates in it

- The new rate law is an approximation (a very good one in this case) of the real system

- You need data to evaluate the utility of a proposed rate law

** Application to enzyme kinetics

- Enzymes are catalysts that speed up the rates of reactions

- The overall reactions are typically $S \rightarrow P$
  - We refer to the reactants as /substrates/ by convention

- Enzyme kinetics often show first order kinetics at low concentration of substrate, and zeroth order kinetics at high concentration of substrate

- Let us propose a mechansim that accounts for this behavior

- We will assume the substrate can bind reversibly with the enzyme to form an enzyme-substrate complex

- The enzyme-substrate complex can react further to form products

\begin{align*}
E + S \rightarrow E\cdot S \\
E\cdot S \rightarrow E + S \\
E\cdot S \rightarrow P + E
\end{align*}

- Now, let us assume that $E\cdot S$ is an active intermediate

\( r_{E\cdot S} = 0 = k_1 [E][S] - k_2 [E\cdot S] - k_3 [E\cdot S]  \)

- Solving for $[E\cdot S]$ yields

\( [E\cdot S] = \frac{k_1 [E][S]}{k_2 + k_3} \)

- This eliminates the hard to detect enzyme-substrate concentration

- However, it is also difficult to measure the concentration of /free/ enzyme $[E]$
  - We usually cannot tell the difference between $[E]$ and $[E\cdot S]$
  - We usually do know the total enzyme concentration $[E_t] = [E] + [E\cdot S]$

\( [E_t] = [E] + \frac{k_1 [E][S]}{k_2 + k_3}  \)

- We can solve that equation for $[E]$

\( [E] = \frac{[E_t](k_2 + k_3)}{k_2 + k_3 + k_1[S]} \)

- Finally, we can write the rate law for production of products:

\begin{align}
r_P &=& k_3 [E\cdot S] \\
    &=& \frac{k_3 k_1 [E][S]}{k_2 + k_3} \\
    &=& \frac{k_1 k_3 [E_t][S]}{k_1 [S] + k_2 + k_3}
\end{align}

- You can see from this rate law that if $k_1[S] \gg k_2 + k_3$ then the overall rate will be practically independent of $[S]$
  - In other words, the rate will be zeroth order in $[S]$
  - That happens because the enzyme is completely saturated with substrate
  - Thus, the rate is determined by the rate of product formation

-  On the other hand, if $k_1[S] \ll k_2 + k_3$ then the rate of product formation will be approximately first order in $[S]$

- The rate depends on the /total enzyme concentration/

#+exercise: Derive a rate law for enzyme kinetics if there is an inhibition reaction. For example:
\begin{align*}
E + S \rightarrow E\cdot S \\
E\cdot S \rightarrow E + S \\
E\cdot S \rightarrow E + P \\
I + E  \rightarrow E\cdot I\\
E\cdot I \rightarrow I + E
\end{align*}

:SOLUTION:
\( r_P = \frac {k_3 E_t [S]}{[S] + (k_2 + k_3)/k_1 (1 + k_4 / k_5 [I])} \)

** An application in catalysis

- In heterogeneous catalysis molecules often
  - adsorb on the surface,
  - react,
  - and then products desorb

- Adsorption occurs on a /site/

- There are a fixed number of sites available

- These lead to behavior similar to the enzyme rate laws

- Let us consider the overall reaction:

\(A + B \rightarrow P \)

- The reaction takes place on a surface, and is postulated to go through this mechanism:

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 200
[[./images/surface-mechanism.png]]

\begin{align*}
A + S &\rightarrow& A^* \\
A^* &\rightarrow& A + S \\
B + S &\rightarrow& B^* \\
B^* &\rightarrow& B + S \\
A^*  + B^* &\rightarrow& P + 2S
\end{align*}

- $A^*$ and $B^*$ are adsorbed surface intermediates

- $S$ is a surface site

- The total concentration of sites is $C_{S0}$
  - $C_{S0} = C_S + C_{A*} + C_{B*}$
  - Sites are not consumed in the reaction, they are regenerated by desorption reactions

- Let us assume the last reaction is very slow

- That implies that the reactions before it may reach equilibrium

- In particular reactions 1 and 2, and reactions 3 and 4 may reach equilibrium

- That implies the following statements are true:

\begin{align}
0 &=& k_1 C_A C_S - k_2 C_{A^*} \label{eq:lh1}\\
0 &=& k_3 C_B C_S - k_4 C_{B^*}
\end{align}

- It is convenient to take the ratio of these equations:

\( \frac{k_4}{k_2}\frac{C_{B^*}}{C_{A^*}} = \frac{k_3}{k_1}\frac{C_B}{C_A} \)

- And then to solve for $C_{B*}$

\begin{equation} \label{eq:lh2}
C_{B^*} = \frac{K_2}{K_1} \frac{C_B}{C_A} C_{A^*}
\end{equation}

  - where we defined $K_1 = \frac{k_1}{k_2}$, $K_2 = \frac{k_3}{k_4}$

- Plugging this result back into equation \ref{eq:lh1} and solving for $C_{A^*}$ leads to (after some algebra)

\begin{align*}
C_{A*} &=& \frac{k_1 C_A C_{S0}}{k_2 + k_1 C_A + k1 K_2/K_1 C_B} \\
       &=& \frac{K_1 C_A C_{S0}}{1 + K_1 C_A + K_2 C_B}
\end{align*}

- Now plugging this result back into \ref{eq:lh2} gives us an expression for $C_{B^*}$

\( C_{B^*} = \frac{K_2 C_B C_{S0}}{1 + K_1 C_A + K_2 C_B} \)

- Finally, we can express the rate of production of products:

\( r_P = k_5 C_{A^*} C_{B^*} = \frac{k_5 K_1 K_2 C_A C_B C_{S0}^2}{(1 + K_1 C_A + K_2 C_B)^2} \)

- This rate law has an important feature
  - It can show negative reaction order

- We consider the rate as a function of the concentration of B here.

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/lh-rate.png]]

- For a fixed concentration of $A$ the rate initially increases with increasing concentration of $B$

- The rate reaches a maximum, and then decreases

- The rate decreases because $A$ and $B$ /compete/ for the available sites and the rate is a /product/ of the two concentrations
  - As the concentration of $B$ increases, the fraction of sites covered by $B$ increases, and the fraction covered by $A$ decreases

- Naturally, by stoichiometry we can get the other species rates:

\( \frac{r_P}{\alpha_P} = \frac{r_A}{\alpha_A} = \frac{r_B}{\alpha_B} = r \)

- The algebra to get here is tedious

- But, consider the benefits

- We have an analytical equation for the rate
  - You can see that there are scenarios where the rate would be first order in A, or B (at low pressures)
  - Or the rate could be constant at higher pressures
  - The rate may actually decrease with increasing A (or B) because they compete for the same sites

- Similar to the enzyme, there is a $C_{S0}$ in the rate
  - You can increase the rate by increasing the number of sites present

- In catalysis it is customary to normalize the concentrations of surface species by the total number of sites
  - $\theta_{A^*} = C_{A^*} / C_{S0}$
  - These are called fractional coverages

- It is also common to use other units for reactions that happen on surfaces

- For example, we do not usually consider the number of sites per unit volume, but per unit of surface area
  - Then we need to know the surface area per unit volume
  - Alternatively, we may use the surface area per unit mass, and the bulk density to relate that back to volume if needed
